            <h3>The Brief</h3>
            <p>For this project, I was asked to design an interactive paper prototype for an app that would address a problem in my partner’s life. (I worked with K, who I will refer to as “my client” throughout the rest of this case study.)</p>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>Bike thieves in London are a huge problem. In 2017 alone, they have stolen my client’s bike twice from a locked, and allegedly secure car park, in his apartment building. They also stole a bike seat from his bike, which was double locked to a bike rack on a busy street in the middle of the day.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Closed car parks and bike locks are not effective in preventing bike theft. My client uses his bike nearly every day. He needs a solution that will guarantees his bike’s security and give him peace of mind.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <h4>Secure, Fast, Convenient</h4>
            <p>My client is busy—between work, school, friends, and his many hobbies and passions, he is always on the go. He loves, and relies on, his bike as his main form of transport around London. He needs to know his bike is safe when parked near home, work, school, or anywhere else. He doesn't want to spend a lot of time finding a place to secure his bike. Currently, no such place or service exists.</p>
            <p>To solve this problem, I developed an app for Bike LockerTM, a new service that would offer 100% guaranteed secure, fully enclosed bike storage spaces. The lockers would be placed in convenient locations all across the city. The app would allow users to reserve a locker and gain access to it.</p>

            <h4>Discovery and Ideation</h4>
            <p>The discovery phase included user interviews, concept mapping, and storyboarding. During our interviews, I learned that of K’s many passions, biking is especially important as it’s not only a hobby, it’s his primary mode of transportation within London. </p>
            <p>Next, I created several concept maps using words that stood out from K’s interview. I created one concept map to focus exclusively on biking a¬nd the challenges K has repeatedly experienced in regard to bike theft.
            </p>
            <p>Next, I created a storyboard of the problem. This helped me visualize the core problem in context, and how my initial idea to solve this problem would fit in within the context of my client’s life.
            </p>
            <p>Each of these activities helped me determine the core underlying challenge—the current lack of a pervasive safe bike storage infrastructure in London.</p>

            <h3>Prototyping and Testing</h3>
            <p>I started by sketching key screens to enable bike locker booking. With additional input from my client, I drafted an initial ”happy path” user flow, which enabled the user to start from the home screen and click through several screens to book a locker.

              <p>Upon testing and gathering feedback, I added more detail, tweaked the sketches and created a wire flow, which I cut into pieces to create a paper prototype. I also added a text message interface that starts when a user confirms a booking and includes confirmation, reminders, such as when a reservation is ending soon, and prompts, such as a suggestion to extend booking if needed.</p>

              <h3>Iterating</h3>
              <p>I made the paper prototype interactive using Marvel App. Upon testing, actionable feedback from K and two data scientists included: condensing the map/results screens, and adding some clearer labels.
              </p>
              <p>I was able to condense the two screens but decided to also keep the original as part of a secondary “happy path”—if the initial results are not sufficient, the user can choose “see all” to see all results.</p>

              <h3>Next Phase</h3>
              <p>Next I would test my revised prototype with K and some other bikers, having them focus especially on the new condensed map/results screen. I’d refine some other features — for example, remove the hamburger icon if not needed, and simplify the interface element that allows users to select the desired times.
              </p>
              <p>I’d also build out the other possible paths including log in/register, account settings, etc, and I’d consult with some technologists to see what level of sophistication is possible in regard to the text message interface. Using the results, I’d refine and develop that aspect as well.
              </p>
              <p>With each new feature, I’d refer back to the research and problem statement in order to stay focused. And I’d repeat the test/iterate/refine process to ensure I was effectively meeting my users’ goals with each revision.</p>
